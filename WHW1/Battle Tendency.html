<p>The second part, <a href='Battle Tendency.html'>Battle Tendency</a>, sees Jonathan's grandson Joseph Joestar crossing the world in the days leading up to the Second World War in 1938-1939 to combat the Pillar<br> Men, an ancient race of hostile beings responsible for the creation of the Stone Mask. Like his grandfather, Joseph undergoes strenuous Ripple training alongside<br> Caesar Anthonio Zeppeli, Will's grandson, under the secretive Lisa Lisa. The three Ripple users and their allies fight to protect the Red Stone of Aja, a gem sought by the<br> Pillar Men to complete the Stone Mask, which would grant them immunity to the sun and dominion over life itself.

<h1>PLOT SUMMARY</h1>
<p>In the winter of 1938, having became a wealthy businessman, Robert E. O. Speedwagon<br> his Speedwagon Foundation have iscovered a Mexican pyramid where they<br>nd various Stone Masks along with a man integrated into a stone column. Fearing the worst, that the horror he and his old friend Jonathan Joestar have thwarted 49 years ago may resurface, Speedwagon contacted Straizo to meet him in Mexico for his aid in destroying the masks and the mysterious figure before he awakens. However, Straizo suddenly kills Speedwagon's associates before badly injuring SpeedwagonÂ himself. Enticed by the youthfulness and vigor the Stone Mask granted Dio, Straizo uses the <br>led blood to activate the Mask and transforms into a Vampire while explaining he intends to eliminate any who know of the Masks.<br>
The series new protagonist: Joseph Joestar
Meanwhile, in New York City, Jonathan's grandson Joseph Joestar defeats a pair of police officers for brutalizing a pickpocket named Smokey Brown and demonstrates his ability to utilize Ripple. Joseph befriends Smokey as he and his grandmother Erina Joestar make the boy feel welcomed. Joseph is soon informed by a mobster of<br>edwagon's presumed death at the hand of Straizo.   
Later after sunset, Joseph is confronted outside a cafe by a vampiric Straizo who intends to kill him before he becomes an actual threat. But Joseph expected the vampire and, after a heated battle, Straizo is defeated. Straizo reveals that after he became a vampire, he was forced to dump Speedwagon and his victims into the river to prevent the spilled blood from reviving the figure in the stone column. The vampire finally self-destructs by breathing the Ripple into himself.
