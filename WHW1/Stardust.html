 <h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); " align="center"><a href='index.html'>Jojo's Part 3(Stardust)</a></h1>

 <p>The third part, <a href='Stardust.html'>Stardust Crusader</a>, is set during 1988-1989. Joseph's grandson, Jotaro Kujo, journeys along with Joseph, Muhammad Avdol, Noriaki Kakyoin, Jean Pierre<br> Polnareff, and Iggy from Tokyo to Cairo in order to fight DIO, who has returned from the depths of the sea, and save his mother from DIO's mystical influence. From Stardust<br> Crusaders onward, protagonists and villains alike primarily use Stands, a usually humanoid representation of the person's spirit, which has become one of the<br> series's most prominent features.
 The first three parts complete Hirohiko Araki's initial vision for the series as a trilogy, but JoJo's Bizarre Adventure continued nonetheless after the end of the third part.

<h1>PLOT SUMMARY</h1>
<p>In 1983 near the Canary Islands, a trio of treasure hunters bring up a casket bearing the engraving of the name "DIO" around dusk. When the ship was found days later, only the empty coffin remained.<br>


Jotaro's "evil spirit"
The story begins in the year 1988 in Tokyo, Japan, with Holy Kujo, daughter of Joseph Joestar, visiting her son Jotaro Kujo after learning he is in jail for having beaten up four people. However, the reason Holy was called was because Jotaro refuses to leave his cell, explaining that he is possessed by an evil spirit. When nobody believes him, he steals a gun and demonstrates its power when it prevents him from shooting himself in the head. Only Holy can see the "spirit" as Jotaro restates his intent to stay in his cell for everyone's well-being.<br>


Jotaro and his "evil spirit"
Holy calls her estranged father, who flies to Japan and arrives at the airport with Holy and his fortune-telling companion Muhammad Avdol. At the police station, he tells the latter to force Jotaro out of his cell by any means. During the fight between Jotaro's "spirit" and Avdol's Magician's Red, Jotaro learns from Joseph that the spirit in his possession is actually a manifestation of his lifeforce, named a Stand. Jotaro's stand gains the upper hand but he exits his cell in the process, prompting Avdol to end the battle.<br>

Joseph displays his Stand Hermit Purple, which enables him to take photographs of faraway places, while he and Avdol explain that Stands manifest in the descendants of those with Stands. Joseph states that the reason he and Jotaro have gained Stands is because of the reemergence of DIO. Knowing only what his grandmother Erina told him, Joseph explains that DIO succeeded in grafting his head onto the body of Jonathan Joestar, which created a link between DIO and Jonathan's descendants. Although Joseph tries to recruit his grandson against the Vampire who has long eluded him, Jotaro hardly believes his story and proof.<br>


Noriaki Kakyoin
The following day, Jotaro heads out to high school as he is stalked by a transfer student named Noriaki Kakyoin. Revealing himself as an assassin sent by DIO to kill those of the Joestar bloodline, Kakyoin uses his Stand Hierophant Green to attack Jotaro. But Jotaro's Stand easily overpowers Kakyoin, who is taken to the Kujo residence where he is revealed to be brainwashed by a parasitic spore produced by DIO. Jotaro risks his life to extract the Flesh Bud and saves Kakyoin.<br>

Tragedy strikes the following day when Holy falls ill due to her own Stand manifesting from DIO's influence. Without the necessary willpower that her son and father possess, Holy is slowly being killed by her own Stand. Joseph and Avdol determine that Holy will die in fifty days unless they kill DIO to break his influence.<br>


The group departs
Motivated by his mother's condition, Jotaro uses his Stand's keen eyesight to analyze the photo Joseph's Stand took of DIO and has it sketch what it could see: A fly which Avdol confirms to be native to Egypt. Kakyoin joins the group and Holy is placed in the care of doctors from the Speedwagon Foundation. Before Jotaro's group departs for the airport, Avdol names Jotaro's Stand, Star Platinum.<br>

<h1>Dio Brando</h1>
<p>DIO (DIOディオ), born Dio Brando (ディオ・ブランドー, Dio Burandō), is the main antagonist of the first and third parts of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, Phantom Blood<br>and Stardust Crusaders, as well as the first main antagonist of the series overall. He is also a postmortem primary antagonist in the sixth part of the series, Stone   Ocean.<br>
    Originally a man of low birth but peerless ambition, DIO is a cunning villain of little conscience and an insatiable hunger for power. After becoming a vampire and later a<br> Stand user wielding the all-powerful The World, DIO gathers many minions around him and sets many of the series's major events in motion. His legacy and influence persists throughout the first six parts of JoJo, with many characters either being related to him or inspired by his charisma and malice.
    He is also the main protagonist of the light novel OVER HEAVEN, the main antagonist of JORGE JOESTAR, and a postmortem primary antagonist in the spin-off manga Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak.
