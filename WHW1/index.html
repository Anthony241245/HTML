<h2 style ="color:black;">PROFILE</h2>
<p style ="color:black;">
JoJo was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump from 1986 to 2004, when it transferred to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump, where it continues to be serialized. The series is collected in a variety of formats ranging from standard tankōbon and paperback volumes to special editions such as hardcover "JoJonium" editions and omnibuses, all of which contain the manga as it was serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump and Ultra Jump, albeit with differences in chapter names and slight dialogue adjustments.

The series has over 120 million copies in print, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history. Filling over 130 volumes, it is Shueisha's second longest-running manga series after Golgo 13.

JoJo's genre spans Action, Adventure, Supernatural, Thriller, Comedy, Tragedy, Mystery, Slice of Life, and Horror. It is perhaps most well known for its Stand phenomenon, the Stardust Crusaders arc featuring Jotaro Kujo and DIO, its expressive renditions of proud, glamorous personalities, and its hundreds of nominal references to Western popular culture.

Adding to the JoJo canon to varying degrees, Araki has also authored several one-shots and artbooks; several spin-offs and light novels have also been published, with many containing original illustrations by Araki.

JoJo was previously the longest Shueisha manga series to not have received an animated adaptation for television, though Stardust Crusaders received an animated adaptation for home video and the Phantom Blood arc received a theatrical animated adaptation. However, the official anime TV series produced by animation studio David Production finally made its debut on October 6, 2012, twenty-five years after the manga began serialization. A film adaptation of the beginning of the manga's Diamond is Unbreakable arc was also released in 2017.

Other merchandise includes several mobile applications and video game adaptations, including several fighting games released internationally; the most recent of these is All-Star Battle R, which was published by Bandai Namco Games on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, Xbox Series X & S, and Steam in 2022.
