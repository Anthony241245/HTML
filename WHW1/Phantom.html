<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first part, <a href='Phantom.html'>Phantom Blood</a>, set in England in 1880-1889, follows Jonathan Joestar as he matures with and eventually<br> combats his adoptive brother, the cunning, merciless Dio Brando, who becomes a Vampire with the help of<br> an ancient Stone Mask. Jonathan is trained by Will Anthonio Zeppeli in the vibrant energy of the Ripple, wielded in the<br> human body and transferred in hand-to-hand combat, which is the only sure way apart from sunlight to defeat<br> Vampires and their Zombie minions.

<h1>PROLOGUE</h1>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Between the 12th and 16th centuries, an Aztec chieftain wearing a Stone Mask stains his mask with a young woman's blood, as part of an Aztec tribe's human sacrifice<br>. This causes many spikes to sprout from the mask, nonlethally piercing the man's skull. The man claims to have gained eternal life, showing off his ability to suck another<br> tribesman's blood with his finger as well as his superhuman strength. It is revealed that this tribe attempted to take over the world, only to vanish for unknown reasons.
Jonathan and Dio meet for the first time<br>
In 1880, at Liverpool, England, a young Jonathan Joestar (known to his friends as JoJo) peacefully lives at his father George Joestar I's wealthy estate. Another young boy from<br> London, Dio Brando, is adopted by them due to his father Dario Brando's death. George believed that he and his infant son were rescued by Dario during a stagecoach accident in which his wife lost her life; in reality, Dario was attempting to loot their corpses. Jonathan attempts to befriend Dio, unaware of his plan to break his spirit<br> through constant bullying and earn George's trust so that he can become the sole heir to the Joestar fortune.
